# UnityAnimationWindow
Adding functionality and fixes to the Unity Animation Window, needs Unity 2019.3.9 and above to function correctly

### How to use
Copy the folder `Custom Animation Window Tryhard` anywhere in the Assets folder and use the window located at `Window/Animation/Enemeteen` (use this window instead of the default one)

### Features

- Added Playback speed, with the option to play backwards
- Added Loop mode and play-once mode
- Added Play from beginning mode
